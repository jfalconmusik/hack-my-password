React Native Android App for bulk password decryption. 

The best use case ise to upload a .txt file filled with encrypted passwords which you've gotten from someone's database somehow, 
such as via sql injection or password phishing. You can't use the passwords when they're encrypted, but you can upload to my server and use this app to try to
decrypt them. You will then be able to view people's passwords in plain text right from my app, and you'll be able to do this in bulk.

Once you make an account, the "upload" option will appear. Without that, the app is basically educational and is just gonna let you know how long it would take to decrypt whatever password you enter.
